# Nook

This app aims to properly track expenses for each rental for small to medium landlords. Landlords can add their properties to the list, add all essential information and track the budget against each unit.

#### A site built from scratch as my first full application project.

## Description
The Nook is my first attempt to create a full-stack application. The intention of developing this application is to demonstrate and practice node.js, express, Mongoose and RESTful routes logic and connect it with HTML and style in CSS in a very condensed period.

I am an inspired entrepreneur and am learning code to find my company one day. Here is my first attempt to build a full-stack application to practice application development. I look for creative solutions to real-world problems and think of technical ways to address them. While no application is ever perfect, I find joy in the process and all my final products!
