The goal of this app is to track expenses for each rental properly for small to medium landlords. Landlords can add their properties to the list, add all basic information and track budget against of each unit.

#### A site built from scratch as my first full application project.

## Description
The Nook is my first attempt to create a full-stack application. The intention of developing this application is to demonstrate and practice node.js, express, Mongoose and RESTful routes logic and connect it with HTML and style in CSS in a very condensed period.

I am an inspired entrepreneur and am learning code to find my company one day. Here is my first attempt to build a game to practice front-end development. I look for creative solutions to real-world problems and think of technical ways to address them. While no application is ever perfect, I find joy in the process and all my final products!
